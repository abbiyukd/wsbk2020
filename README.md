4. If you found another bug, please do tell

## TO DO
This mod is open to all other modders who want and have time to continue (since the most of our team is too busy) <br>
The following list is this mod lack of :
- Some riders still uses plain black or white color with number helmet <br> and some of the others still uses old helmet design taken from various sources
- Mechanics crew liveries, rider props (caps and .etc), umbrella & umbrella girls
- Pitbox skin
- Custom Teams liveries (suits & bikes) <br> 
(Only Aprilia RSV4 bike that has correct livery and still only have 1 for 3 design slot, the other bikes and all custom suits still untouched)
- Correcting custom teams names, sponsors, manufacturer (after the liveries are done of course)
- Fixing aprilia RSV4 gauge bug 
- Switching official rider's faces to generics
- Changing riding style
- Updating some of bike ui menu image
- Other small details you can find and .etc
- The models may will be updated using models from Ride4 (depends on the circumstances if its possible or not)
- We are providing the necessary 3d .obj models for skinning that you can use and some guidance <br>
